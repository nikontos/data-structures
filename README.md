# data-structures
> Usefull data structures for personal help, some algorithms also included.

### ListMerge.java
> This file contains both data structure and algorithm required to Merge 2 Lists.
> It choses the smaller list to traverse and places right of the Head of the big list ( BigListHead.next -> SmallListHead )


### Stack.java
> A Stack data structure made with generic types, supports void pop(), void push(), boolean isEmpty(), String toString()

### Calculator.java 
> Calculates arithmetic expressions using Djikstra's two stack Algorithm, uses Stack.java to operate the Stacks.


### TO DO 
* Add more Data Structures
* Update Calculator.java to check for Syntax Errors
